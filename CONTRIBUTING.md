### How to report a bug 

If you've found a bug, please make sure that everything is tested correctly and it is not a mistake. Then if you're 99.99% sure that it's a bug, you can create an issue on the GitHub repo. 
Also make sure that a similar issue does not exist previously.
Please note that security issues should be reported via email only and should not be discussed in public, because that might cause more issues rather that resolving it. 

### How to submit changes

We highly recommend you to fork this repo on GitHub, clone it locally and then start working on it. If you've already did that, then you can create a pull request on GitHub. We'll review your changes and if everything looks OK we'll merge it.
